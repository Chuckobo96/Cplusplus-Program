In this project, I was asked to create a clock on a website that would allow the viewers to read the time using a standard 12-hour clock and a 24-hour clock as well. I was particularly well with branches and loops. I believe my code showed my efficiency in if, while and switch statements. I suppose some improvements I could make with my code is better improving my use of whitespaces to make my code more readable to other coders. Writing the code wasn't too challenging as I am very comfortable with loops and switches. However, looking back over my code to find errors was a minor struggle and I had overcome this by regularly compiling the code I had written to check for errors and grammar mistakes. I believe the skills I had demonstrated with this project will be useful in other projects requiring extensive use of loops and branches.
